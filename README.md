## What is 'Codesplanation'?

Codesplanation is a platform dedicated towards the betterment of the developer code-sharing and understanding experience.

Currently, developers attempting to explain their code are limited to a few primary options:

- contaminating their code with excessive comments
- overly detailing readme's and/or documentation
- writing time consuming blog posts and articles

Codesplanation aims to solve these issues. Instead of writing lengthy documents, exhaustive articles or going through comment chaos, developers can instead annotate their code snippets line-by-line. This enables developers to clearly express their logic and intentions whilst allowing readers to have a better and more effective code-consumption experience.

If, by chance, a reader doesn't understand some of the written and/or annotated code, they are then able to narrow down their misunderstanding(s) to facilitate faster knowledge transfer.

### Purpose

**To facilitate clear, concise explanations of code snippets, segments and blocks for all developers, regardless of level, allowing other developers to read, understand and consume code faster and more effectively.**
